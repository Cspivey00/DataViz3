## Original Thoughts on the BBC Map:

The title was effective and the information below provided context for the map. The first thing that I noticed is that it's a very hard map to follow because it's geographically flipped and there are no labels for the countries. Furthermore, the purple stands out to highlight the countries that have been declared atleast one case of the coronavirus, however there is no gradient scale to provide any context. I find this problematic because it lacks context on the global stage of which areas are more/less impacted. Additionally, I dislike the way that the information is provided below the map. Countries are listed in order of highest number of cases to lowest, but this isn't sensible because all areas with atleast one case are colored purple. Ideally without a gradient the map would list countries alphabetically. I would adjust all of these elements. IE: Flipping the map orientation, creating a gradient scale, labeling countries that are impacted or including darker borders for impacted countries, and reordering the countries impacted alphabetically or in order of the gradient (Depending on how the final product looked). 

Wireframing for potential solutions:

I played with Basalmiq for probably over an hour before I decided that was a terrible program to try and create a map on -- Infogram was much cleaner and easier for mapping objects. Of course, I could have always drawn it on pen and paper, but that seemed like quite a process for something so visually intense as a color coded world map with around 25 key points. 

Infogram seemed like a much more sensible approach. The mapping options were more numerous and I was able to import data into the program to draw up a highlighted version with a gradient color scale while creating a readable legend. However, It was much less of a rough draft that Basalmiq. 

Unfortunately, I did not see a code for Infogram (mentioned alongside the reference code for Basalmiq) and wasn't able to download my infogram piece. I did take a screenshot and will email that over, if it will be easier. 

## Testing and Finetuning the Wireframe:

The response to my sketch on Infogram were as follows: 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
A map charting the number of cases of the coronavirus in different countries. 
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The same as above. A map with a gradient color scheme charting number of cases in different countries
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
No. 
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The assumed intended audience was the general public because the data isnâ€™t very in depth or hard to understand. 
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
China should be a different color to note origin. 

Other Remarks: 
One person wanted more labels for other countries to provide reference points.
The color gradience helps a lot with distinguishing which countries have more/less cases. 
The geographic locations are good with the buffers around country locations and are easy to distinguish with labels
The map orientation is much better than the previous version. 
Add more labels. 
The data at the bottom might be redundant. Or maybe it should be displayed differently?  

## Final map built by Tableau to track the spread of Coronavirus's in other countries

Interestingly, when I published the final piece to Tableau Public (for online storage purposes), it deleted the Tableau project out of my workbook... Not sure what the issue is there. 

I thought the read, critique, wireframe, and final process was interesting. 

As soon as I saw the BBC chart I found it spatially and visually confusing which is why I chose to re design it. The same colors and lack of geographical indicators made the map confusing as previously stated. 

I thought that the critique method was good. It was certianly more intentional than the first and well explained in the document. However, it focused hevily on the informative side and not as much on the emotive side which is a potential weakness. It did assist with identifying which elements of the chart were weak and needed the most improvement -- such as the title, gradient color scale, legend, etc.

The wireframing process was the most mind boggling part of this entire process. It wasn't hard to plan which elements to change after the critique process, however the Balsamiq program wasn't useful and the infogram program was better but still limited to my knowledge -- which is little. I think it would be beneficial if we had more time in this class with less programs because it's a constant learning curve with little depth. The programs aren't hard, but it would take some time before I would be *comfortable* with the programs to a high degree. 

Having other people critique my graphs on the other hand was fun. I enjoyed the feedback and was pleased that it turned out better than the BBC map, although I certainly had a lot of room for improvement as well. It's worth noting that I thought some of their comments were structurally wrong while others (such as adding more labels and creating more constrast in the color scheme) I had already thought about by the time they returned with feedback. 

It was certainly a draft and redraft process. I worked through it 3 or 4 times in the wireframing process trying to play with different layouts, color schemes, transparencies, etc. In the future I will keep more drafts of those as I'm working -- but at the time they seemed like unfinished products and therefore not warranted to be saved.
